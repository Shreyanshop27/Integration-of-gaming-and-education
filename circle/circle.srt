1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:03,233
so if we divide a circle into even more smaller pieces

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:04,466
you can see that every time

3
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:05,999
the shape becomes more like a rectangle

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,166
so how small was we divide a circle

5
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,966
before we can get a perfect rectangle

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,666
well we can keep on doing the circle into small

7
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,966
smaller or the smallest pieces you can make

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,866
but the answer is to divide the circle infinitely

9
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,599
many times until we can distinguish the lines

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,133
and eventually

11
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,099
the circle can now become the perfect rectangle

12
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:29,266
so the area of the circle

13
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,299
is equal to the area of the rectangle

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,666
which is equal to base times height

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,133
the height of the rectangle

16
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:33,666
as you can see

17
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,666
is the same as the radius

18
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,066
so height is equal to radius

19
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,466
to find the base

20
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,299
we need to look at the circumference of the circle

21
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,266
and when we compare the base on the circumference

22
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:42,599
we can see that the base is equal to

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,900
1/2 the circumference

24
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,699
remember that the circumference is equal to 2 by R

25
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,299
when we combine with 1/2

26
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,266
the 2 is canceled out

27
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,033
and base is equal to by R

28
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,399
so now base times height becomes pi r times r

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,600
Combine the r together and we have pi r squared

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,166
which is equal to the air of the rectangle

31
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,866
which is equal to the air of the circle
